# This module, while seemingly having a funny name, has a truthful name.
# It dis(assembles) the integration within the NixOS module system that is
# causing issues for mobile-nixos.

# In reality, all fixups made here is a call for a better isolation of the
# modules they target. Let's wait until this is more stable, and add required
# fixes to the NixOS modules system as needed â˜º.
